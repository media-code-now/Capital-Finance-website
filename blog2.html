              <p>
                Investing in stocks is an excellent way to grow wealth. For
                long-term investors, stocks are a good investment even during
                periods of market volatility — a stock market downturn like the
                one we've seen this year simply means that many stocks are on
                sale.
              </p>
              <h3>Step 1. Decide how you want to invest in stocks</h3>
              <p>
                There are several ways to approach stock investing. Choose the
                option below that best represents how you want to invest, and
                how hands-on you'd like to be in picking and choosing the stocks
                you invest in.
              </p>
              <h3>Step 2. Open an investing account</h3>
              <p>
                Generally speaking, to invest in stocks, you need an investment
                account. For the hands-on types, this usually means a brokerage
                account. For those who would like a little help, opening an
                account through a robo-advisor is a sensible option. We break
                down both processes below.
              </p>
              <p>
                An important point: Both brokers and robo-advisors allow you to
                open an account with very little money — we list several
                providers with low or no account minimum below.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Step 3. Know the difference between stocks and stock mutual
                funds
              </h3>
              <p>
                The upside of stock mutual funds is that they are inherently
                diversified, which lessens your risk. For the vast majority of
                investors — particularly those who are investing their
                retirement savings — a portfolio comprised mostly of mutual
                funds is the clear choice.
              </p>
              <p>
                But mutual funds are unlikely to rise in meteoric fashion as
                some individual stocks might. The upside of individual stocks is
                that a wise pick can pay off handsomely, but the odds that any
                individual stock will make you rich are exceedingly slim.
              </p>
              <h3>Step 4. Set a budget for your stock investment</h3>
              <p>
                How much money do I need to start investing in stocks? The
                amount of money you need to buy an individual stock depends on
                how expensive the shares are. (Share prices can range from just
                a few dollars to a few thousand dollars.) If you want mutual
                funds and have a small budget, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may
                be your best bet. Mutual funds often have minimums of $1,000 or
                more, but ETFs trade like a stock, which means you purchase them
                for a share price — in some cases, less than $100.
              </p>
              <p>
                How much money should I invest in stocks? If you’re investing
                through funds — have we mentioned this is our preference? — you
                can allocate a fairly large portion of your portfolio toward
                stock funds, especially if you have a long time horizon. A
                30-year-old investing for retirement might have 80% of his or
                her portfolio in stock funds; the rest would be in bond funds.
                Individual stocks are another story. We’d recommend keeping
                these to 10% or less of your investment portfolio.
              </p>
              <h3>Step 5. Start investing</h3>
              <p>
                Stock investing is filled with intricate strategies and
                approaches, yet some of the most successful investors have done
                little more than stick with the basics. That generally means
                using funds for the bulk of your portfolio — Warren Buffett has
                famously said a low-cost S&P 500 index fund is the best
                investment most Americans can make — and choosing individual
                stocks only if you believe in the company’s potential for
                long-term growth.
