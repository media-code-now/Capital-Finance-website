              <p>
                Where will your retirement money come from? If you’re like most
                people, qualified-retirement plans, Social Security, and
                personal savings and investments are expected to play a role.
                Once you have estimated the amount of money you may need for
                retirement, a sound approach involves taking a close look at
                your potential retirement-income sources.
              </p>
              <h3>1.Retirement Researcher</h3>
              <p>
                If you’re looking for something a little bit different and a lot
                more serious, Retirement Researcher might be for you. Author
                Wade Pfau, has a nice set of credentials. He has a Ph.D. in
                economics from Princeton, he’s the Director of Retirement
                Research for McLean Asset Management and Professor of Retirement
                Income at The American College.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Retirement Researcher, you’ll find scores of blog posts
                inspired by his, you guessed it, retirement research. Current
                topics include longevity insurance, annuity pricing, how to make
                your savings last without staying in the workforce, and the
                importance of getting financial advice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pfau’s blog is just about as straightforward as they come. You
                won’t find any cartoon figures or nonsense. What you will find
                is a lot of information about planning your retirement the
                smartest way.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Freakonomics</h3>
              <p>
                If all this blog had was its name, it’d be worth a click.
                Fortunately, it’s got a lot more than that. Freakonomics is an
                irreverent, smart financial blog that’s authored by economist
                Steven D. Levitt and writer Stephen J. Dubner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spawned by the book of the same name, then SuperFreakonomics,
                then When to Rob a Bank (that’s a real book, by the way), this
                New York Times bestselling duo created their award-winning
                financial blog that focuses more on money in general. But as
                Chatzky says, their musing on “seemingly random things” is well
                worth the read.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trending right now are podcasts and posts on the economics of
                sleep, the healthcare revolution, the World Bank, and whether
                early retirement is bad for your health. This is a random blog
                with a lot of podcasts, and you never know what they’ll talk
                about from one day to the next.
              </p>
              <h3>4. Can I Retire Yet?</h3>
              <p>
                As Darrow Kirkpatrick’s tagline, “Save More – Invest Smart –
                Retire Sooner,” implies, Can I Retire Yet? is about getting
                retired as soon as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kirkpatrick combines his Eagle Scout values and live simple
                philosophy with a clear eyed view of retirement resources to
                offer advice and insight to help you retire early, but securely.
                With retirement calculator reviews and advice that covers
                everything from leisure activities to deep dives into investment
                portfolios, the mission of Can I Retire Yet is to help others
                become financially independent.
              </p>
              <h3>5. NewRetirement</h3>
              <p>
                Of course we want to mention a little something about ourselves.
                NewRetirement was founded because our own parents needed
                straightforward advice about how to make retirement work and we
                realized that there was no one resource talking about all of the
                various retirement planning strategies: from tapping into home
                equity and finding a retirement job to exploring the best ways
                invest to maximize retirement income or get rid of debt. We have
                grown to have hundreds of thousands of readers and users of our
                award winning retirement planning calculator.
