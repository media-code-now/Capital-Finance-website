        <h2>Why A Bespoke Solution Can Sometimes Be The Only Solution</h2>

        <p>
          An off-the-shelf solution is a solution that you purchase (often
          through an account and subscription) to use 'as-is' - or
          off-the-shelf. Sometimes these solutions offer you the ability to
          customise the approach and/or the look and feel; but on the whole, you
          simply take the system and make use of it out of the box. These
          solutions are often built to satisfy a larger client-base and you will
          often find that the deliverables/features are more generic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively a bespoke solution (or custom solution) is one that is
          built specifically around the requirements of the project. Rather than
          adhering to a wider range of generic requirements; the bespoke
          solution focuses on the core deliverables the client requires and
          delivers on the specifics.
        </p>
        <p>
          At DCODE, we work with both off-the-shelf solutions as well as bespoke
          solutions - there is often always a case for each alternative in every
          project. However, in some instances only a bespoke solution will do.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your business is relying on the software to deliver a
          service/solution (and interact with a consumer); then a bespoke system
          can allow you to deliver that service with your own level of
          individuality - inline with the way you have differentiated yourself
          from the competition. Only a bespoke solution can offer this. If you
          choose to use an off-the-shelf solution, then often you are conforming
          to the same "standards"/"methodology" as others who use that solution.
          A bespoke solution can allow you to differentiate yourself and provide
          a point of difference by enforcing your differentiated strategy as
          part of your systems/processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before developing your next solution, it is important that you
          evaluate alternatives on both sides of the development spectrum and
          chose the option that best suits the requirements of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking to develop a system/solution for your business,
          contact us to find out how we can be of assistance. As IT Consultants,
          DCODE can assist you in identifying your system requirements and then
          determining the best alternatives available. We can help you to
          evaluate Cloud Apps and/or Custom Software solutions and chose the one
          that suits you. And with our in-house development team, we can either
          implement a Cloud App or develop and launch your Custom Software
          solution. If you're interested in rationalising your operations with
          technology,
